    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dough</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¾ cup water</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>2 cups white bread flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>1 ½ tablespoons nonfat dry milk powder</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon fast-rising dry yeast</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Sauce</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>¼ cup light corn syrup</li>
      <li>¼ cup butter</li>
      <li>¼ cup chopped pecans (Optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Filling</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>¼ cup butter, softened</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Make dough: Combine water, butter, bread flour, white sugar, milk powder, yeast, and salt, in that order, in the bucket of a bread machine. Select the Dough cycle. Remove dough from the machine after the cycle is done, about 1 hour 45 minutes.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, make sauce: Combine brown sugar, corn syrup, and butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Pour sauce into an 8-inch square baking pan. Sprinkle with pecans and set aside.</li>
      <li>Fill dough: Turn dough out onto a floured surface, punch it down, and roll into an 8x12-inch rectangle. Dot with butter and sprinkle with cinnamon. Roll up and pinch seams together. Slice roll into 9 equal pieces, about 1 1/3-inches thick; place cut-side down into the baking pan on top of pecans. Set aside until rolls are doubled in size, about 1 hour.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
      <li>Bake rolls in the preheated oven until golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan for no more than 3 minutes; invert a serving platter on top of the pan, then turn over. Carefully remove the pan to release rolls and allow pecan sauce to flow over rolls.</li>
