    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The creamy cheese sauce and tender potatoes in this classic French dish
      make a delicious flavor combination. Serve potatoes au gratin with a roast
      pork loin or beef tenderloin, alongside a green salad.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>4 medium russet potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, sliced into rings</li>
      <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>2 cups milk</li>
      <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter a 1-quart
        casserole dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Layer 1/2 of the potatoes in the bottom of the prepared casserole dish;
        season with salt and pepper. Layer onion slices over top, then top with
        with remaining potatoes. Season again with salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Gradually whisk in
        flour and salt and cook, whisking constantly until raw flour flavor has
        cooked off, about 1 minute. Gradually add milk, about 1/4 cup at a time,
        whisking well after each addition to incorporate; the gradual addition
        and whisking of milk will help avoid lumps in your sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook, whisking constantly, until the mixture has thickened, 3 to 5
        minutes. Stir in cheese all at once; continue stirring until melted, 30
        to 60 seconds. Pour cheese sauce over the potatoes, and cover the dish
        with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender and sauce is
        bubbly, about 1 ½ hours.
      </li>
    </ol>
